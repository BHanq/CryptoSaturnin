# CryptoSaturnin

## Title 
Saturnin: a suite of lightweight symmetric algorithms for
post-quantum security

### Goal
We had to review an cryptography based paper, we choose saturnin for its lightweithness (aiming IoT devices) and post-quantum security (to prepare for a day where quantum computer are going to be """normal""")
